        The internet is a large place with a huge variety of websites, pictures,
        stories, and videos that you can access. While most of these are
        educational and beneficial for us, there are certain things that are not
        meant for us to see. Some things online may upset us and leave us in a
        confused state. This happens because we don't have enough knowledge yet
        to understand it.

        While you may not be expecting to see it, if you do come across such
        content, fear not! We will guide you on what to do, and how to cope with
        it.

        There are few things online that we understand after reaching a certain
        age as we become more mature and are able to rationally process what we
        see. There is a high chance you unintentionally come across this content
        while surfing the net. Such content is not made in your best interests,
        which is why in this module, we will help support you as to how you can
        go about it.
