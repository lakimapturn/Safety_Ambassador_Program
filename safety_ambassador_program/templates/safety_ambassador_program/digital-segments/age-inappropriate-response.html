        The Internet is a big space. It is very open and vast, connecting people
        all around the world. It teaches us, students, so many important things.
        It is, also, very dangerous if we do not understand where we need to go
        or how we need to responsibly use the World Wide Web.

        When you find yourself in a difficult situation, such as finding
        uncomfortable things online, you may be confused. You mustn't worry! The
        Safety Ambassadors encourage you to think of an adult- it may be your
        parents or your teachers. Letting an adult know about what you find
        disturbing is a good start to making the Internet a much safer space for
        you and your friends to learn and grow.

        Seeing inappropriate content at a young age can leave children feeling
        confused and unable to process what they have seen or experienced.
      </p>
      <p>We must first understand the effect it has on us…</p>
      <p>
        Viewing age-inappropriate content online can subconsciously alter a
        student's developing mindset and encourage them to behave erratically.
        Inappropriate content hazards a safety risk- it can cause mental and
        emotional damage to children of any age, especially very young children.
        It can cause them to have nightmares or a change in behavior, more so if
        the content was very vivid.

    Now that we've understood what is classified as inappropriate on the
    internet, we must ask ourselves:
    <br />
    <strong class="text-center"
      >What do we do when we find such content?</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Stumbling upon inappropriate content at a young age can leave you feeling
    confused and unable to process what you have seen or experienced.

    Reporting such a problem is a good step to take to protect your friends and
    yourself from the same problem. Alerting your teacher, your parent, a
    trusted adult or a Safety Ambassador is a powerful step to decrease your
    exposure to the same. We would be able to help you feel more comfortable
    online, safely browse your interests and learn new things!
