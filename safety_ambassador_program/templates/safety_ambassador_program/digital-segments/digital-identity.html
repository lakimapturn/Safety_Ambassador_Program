                <b>Digital Identity</b> refers to any personal information - a <b>digital profile</b> - that helps the internet identify you as a unique individual. It consists of your <i>name, address, age, profession, email, photos</i> you have uploaded to social media, posts you have commented on or liked and much more. The digital world increases its knowledge about you with every click of your keyboard, every website you visit, every person you interact with and every item you shop online. Take a moment to think about what your current digital identity would comprise of. Have you been a mindful digital citizen?

                        <li>Nothing is temporary online. Everything you do is <b>recorded</b> and <b>monitored</b>, which is why you must be <b>careful</b> and aware of what you do on the internet.</li>
                        <li>Keep your profile as <b>private</b> as possible. This makes it harder for hackers and stalkers to know about your life.</li>
                        <li><b>Be aware</b> of what you post online. Think twice about posting a picture that's private to you. If there are others in the photo, make sure you have their <b>consent</b> before uploading it anywhere.</li>
                        <li><b>Avoid</b> getting into any arguments or spats online. If there are any concerns, take it up with the person face to face. Trying to prove a point online will often make things worse as there could be more misunderstandings and miscommunication.</li>
                        <li>Engaging in conversations with strangers might seem appealing and harmless at the first but it could lead you down a dangerous road. The person you connect with online might not be who you think they are. Is it worth the risk?</li>
                        <li>It is important to <b>stay calm</b> while on the internet. Take breathers and breaks from social media.</li>

            Most hackers use information such as your nickname or the name of your first pet. etc to hack into accounts. This is why websites suggest a random combination of characters to make a strong password.

            While for reliable websites it is pretty obvious that you have to put in all the necessary information required, when in doubt, ask a trusted adult.
