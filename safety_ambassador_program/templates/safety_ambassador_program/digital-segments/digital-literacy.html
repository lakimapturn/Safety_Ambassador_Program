            Most hackers use information such as your nickname or the name of your first pet. etc to hack into accounts. This is why websites suggest a random combination of characters to make a strong password.       
        {% else %}
        Google scholar is a reliable website which will only give you verified information
        Unlike that, anyone can write a tweet and a comment on youtube, so it isn't always reliable. We are not saying that everyone on the internet is a liar, but not everyone on the internet is correct all the time either.
