                    Take yourself as an example - You are accessing this platform with the help of your device and our good friend, The Internet. Sometimes, this very Internet can be a confusing friend to deal with. There are times when you spend so much time on the internet - on your device - that you forget about your real friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to maintain a healthy relation with technology. We need to be able to use the internet in a way that supports and takes us closer to our goal, rather than distracting or shutting us off from the real world around us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the recent world events, the internet has become an important part of our lives. We use it for a number of reasons – from completing assignments, engaging in research work, connecting with family/friends as well as for entertainment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this video, we may be able to understand that balancing our digital life and our real life is very important. Further into the module, we will explain the precautions we must keep in mind while using our devices.
