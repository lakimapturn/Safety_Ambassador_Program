          <b>Digital Wellbeing </b>is an important part of our lives. All people
          irrespective of age, culture or colour, use modern technology and
          <b>depend</b> on it to complete daily tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take yourself as an example - You are accessing this platform with the
          help of your device and our good friend, The Internet. Sometimes, this
          very Internet can be a confusing friend to deal with. There are times
          when you spend so much time on the internet - on your device - that
          you forget about your real friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to maintain a <b>healthy relation</b> with technology.
          We need to be able to use the internet in a way that supports and
          takes us closer to our goal, rather than distracting or shutting us
          off from the real world around us.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the recent world events, the internet has become an
          <b>important part</b> of our lives. We use it for a number of reasons
          - from completing assignments, engaging in research work, connecting
          with family/friends as well as for entertainment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this video, we may be able to understand that
          <b>balancing</b> our digital life and our real life is very important.
          Further into the module, we will explain the precautions we must keep
          in mind while using our devices.
