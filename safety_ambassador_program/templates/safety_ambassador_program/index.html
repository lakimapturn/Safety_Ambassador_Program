                        Take yourself as an example… you are accessing this wonderful platform of information through the help of your device and our best friend: The Internet. Sometimes, though, the Internet can be a confusing friend to deal with. Sometimes you spend so much time on the internet- on your device- that you forget about your real friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is <b>important</b> to note the balance, and use the internet in a safe and healthy way.

                        <b>Digital Identity</b> is a set of characteristics- a digital profile of your own personality- that often helps the internet identify you as a unique individual. It consists of your name, address, age, profession, email and more. It increases it’s knowledge on you with every click of your keyboard, every website you visit, and every item you shop online.

                                <li>Nothing is temporary online. Everything you do is recorded and monitored which is why you must be careful and aware of what you do on the internet.</li>
                                <li>Keep your profile as private as possible. This makes it harder for hackers and stalkers to know about your life.</li>
                                <li>Be aware of what you post online. Think twice about posting a picture that’s private to you. If there are others in the photo, make sure you have their consent before uploading it anywhere.</li>
                                <li>It is important to stay calm while on the internet. Take breathers and breaks from social media. Avoid getting into any arguments or spats online.</li>
